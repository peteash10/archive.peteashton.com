We\u2019re now ready to get back to it, so here\u2019s a quick update on what\u2019s been happening. <\/p>\n<p>We met with our carpenter, Matt Moore, last week to talk through our plans. We chose Matt because he can bring an artistic sensibility to the project along with being a competent chippy, so the camera should look great as well as be a hard-wearing contraption. We\u2019re hoping he can start work next month. <\/p>\n<p>We also had a generous donation of some lenses from Tim Norgate at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pinholesolutions.co.uk\/\">Pinhole Solutions<\/a> in Birmingham who we met last year. Tim become obsessed with the camera obscurae a few years ago but his kit has been in the attic. It\u2019s now being put back to use. Thanks Tim!<\/p>\n<p>Immediately after the Kickstarter ended we put in an application to the Arts Council for funding to develop Birmingham Obscura into a sustainable resource for arts and education through an enhanced program of events this year. We\u2019ll hear if we\u2019re successful on Feb 5th but even if we\u2019re not (arts funding, like everything, has been cut to the bone in recent years) we\u2019ll be out and about a lot. <\/p>\n<p>The first thing we\u2019ll definitely be doing is an installation for the <a href=\"http:\/\/flatpackfestival.org.uk\/\">Flatpack Film Festival<\/a>. The exact location is still being negotiated but expect a giant tent camera somewhere in Birmingham City Centre in the last week of March. <\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re settling in nicely at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bom.org.uk\/\">Birmingham Open Media (BOM)<\/a> in the centre of Birmingham. The studio has been cleaned up and kitted out so we can do whatever we need to do in there. We\u2019ll also be running a series of events over the spring in association with BOM. Some will be about the project sharing our learnings, some will be more like workshops. Once these are scheduled we\u2019ll let you know.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>(Edited version of Kickstarter update) Hope you had a good Xmas break.
