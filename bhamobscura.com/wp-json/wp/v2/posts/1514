We do try and work together as collaboratively as we can, and try not to be too prescriptive with our roles. Having said that, when it comes to lugging around large pieces of wood, much easier when Pete\u2019s there!<\/p>\n<p>The first challenge was actually transporting the kit, which <a href=\"http:\/\/www.danburwood.co.uk\/\">Dan Burwood<\/a> helped out with, with his large van. The second challenge was recruiting somebody to help out on the day, as a second body. Luckily <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kerryleslie.com\">Kerry Leslie<\/a>, my good chum and sometimes colleague, eagerly said yes when I asked her a few weeks ago! Sorted.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1518\" src=\"http:\/\/bhamobscura.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2015\/07\/20150718_113748-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"20150718_113748\" width=\"625\" height=\"469\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.ash10.com\/bhamobscura\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2015\/07\/20150718_113748-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.ash10.com\/bhamobscura\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2015\/07\/20150718_113748-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.ash10.com\/bhamobscura\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2015\/07\/20150718_113748-624x468.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Then came the day, we loaded up the van at <a href=\"http:\/\/bom.org.uk\">Bom<\/a> at early am and headed over cheerfully to the Jewellery Quarter Festival site. It was then, when unloading the van I realised I\u2019d forgotten our brand new, shiny silver curtain: shucks. Rang Kerry and she brought it on her way into town thankfully, but in the meantime I used a tarp we always take out in case of showers! The corner I chose to set up on was extremely windy so there were moments when the sides of the camera were acting as sails in the wind. With a *little* help just lifting the heavier pieces onto the top of the structure, we were BUILT.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1519\" src=\"http:\/\/bhamobscura.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2015\/07\/IMG_7994-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_7994\" width=\"625\" height=\"833\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.ash10.com\/bhamobscura\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2015\/07\/IMG_7994-768x1024.jpg 768w, http:\/\/www.ash10.com\/bhamobscura\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2015\/07\/IMG_7994-225x300.jpg 225w, http:\/\/www.ash10.com\/bhamobscura\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2015\/07\/IMG_7994-624x832.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" \/> <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1520\" src=\"http:\/\/bhamobscura.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2015\/07\/IMG_8005-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_8005\" width=\"625\" height=\"469\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.ash10.com\/bhamobscura\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2015\/07\/IMG_8005-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.ash10.com\/bhamobscura\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2015\/07\/IMG_8005-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.ash10.com\/bhamobscura\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2015\/07\/IMG_8005-624x468.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The festival had a lovely atmosphere and was well organised by the JQ Bid team. There was lots going on and a good crowd came through around lunchtime for several hours. We had some interesting conversations and also saw some familiar faces. We even had some coppers have a look, as well as the festival security. It wasn't as busy as CoCoMad as it was a very different event, but really glad we were invited along.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1522\" src=\"http:\/\/bhamobscura.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2015\/07\/IMG_8015-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_8015\" width=\"625\" height=\"469\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.ash10.com\/bhamobscura\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2015\/07\/IMG_8015-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.ash10.com\/bhamobscura\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2015\/07\/IMG_8015-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.ash10.com\/bhamobscura\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2015\/07\/IMG_8015-624x468.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Bham Obscura outing to the first Jewellery Quarter Festival was the first time I (Jenny) had done this without Pete.
