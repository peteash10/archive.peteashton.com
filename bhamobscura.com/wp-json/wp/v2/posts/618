But maybe I just wasn't paying attention.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s an intriguing set-up that\u2019s different from anything else I\u2019d seen. For a start the lens is embedded in a window and the mirror rotates around a vertical axis. Most cameras, ours included, have the lens in the roof and the mirror moving on the horizontal, but there\u2019s no reason it can\u2019t be done this or any other way.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/bhamobscura.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2014\/09\/pgcam2.gif\" alt=\"pgcam2\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-673\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This sideways look also solves the problem of being on in London building with a view of the brickwork opposite. The mirror allows you to look along the street and see people walking towards the gallery and really does mess with your perceptions.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/bhamobscura.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2014\/09\/pgcam4.gif\" alt=\"pgcam4\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-674\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The other difference is the chamber itself which I was surprised to see is a standard function room of a substantial size. When I first went in I thought the camera would be one of the cupboards but it\u2019s the whole room.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/bhamobscura.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2014\/09\/pgcam1.gif\" alt=\"pgcam1\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-675\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Blackout binds are lowered and the lens projects on to a free-standing screen on wheels which can be moved to focus the image. This was an innovation I hadn\u2019t seen before, solving the problem of integrating a focus mechanism into the lens housing. To focus you simply move the screen, which is also semi-opaque so you can see the image on both sides.<\/p>\n<p>The size and format of the room means you can have a large number of people looking at the camera, which does lessen the intimacy a bit, but also opens it up to new possibilities. This is not a recreation of a Victorian gentleman\u2019s folly, nor an Englightenment drawing tool. This is figuring out what a camera obscura is today.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>And ultimately, it\u2019s just a hole in the wall. Always born of simplicity, these things.<\/p>\n<p><em>Thanks loads to Vikki Jessop for arranging an out of hours look at the camera!<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Photographers\u2019 Gallery in London has a camera obscura and it's a little different from the norm.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[3],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/bhamobscura.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/618"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/bhamobscura.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/bhamobscura.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/bhamobscura.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/bhamobscura.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=618"}],"version-history":[{"count":62,"href":"http:\/\/bhamobscura.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/618\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":798,"href":"http:\/\/bhamobscura.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/618\/revisions\/798"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/bhamobscura.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=618"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/bhamobscura.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=618"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/bhamobscura.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=618"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
